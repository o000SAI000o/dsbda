Of course! Let‚Äôs go **step-by-step** and **properly explain** the full code you just got.  
I'll explain **what each part does** and **why it's needed** according to your **problem statement**.

# üß† Full Code Explanation

---

## 1. **Import Required Libraries**

```python
import nltk
from nltk import sent_tokenize, word_tokenize, pos_tag
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from nltk.stem import PorterStemmer, WordNetLemmatizer
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
import string
```
- **nltk** (Natural Language Toolkit) is a Python library for text processing.
- **sent_tokenize** ‚Üí Breaks text into sentences.
- **word_tokenize** ‚Üí Breaks text into words.
- **pos_tag** ‚Üí Adds Part-of-Speech (POS) labels like noun, verb, adjective, etc.
- **stopwords** ‚Üí List of common words like *is, the, and* that add no special meaning.
- **PorterStemmer** ‚Üí Cuts words to their "root" (example: *playing ‚Üí play*).
- **WordNetLemmatizer** ‚Üí Reduces words to their correct dictionary form (example: *better ‚Üí good*).
- **TfidfVectorizer** ‚Üí Calculates Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF).
- **string** ‚Üí Helps remove punctuations.

---

## 2. **Download necessary NLTK Data**

```python
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('wordnet')
nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')
nltk.download('stopwords')
```
- Downloads tokenizers, lemmatizer dictionaries, POS tagger models, and stopword lists so your code can run without errors.

---

## 3. **Sample Text Input**

```python
text = """Real Madrid is set to win the UCL for the season. Benzema might win Ballon d'Or. Salah might be the runner-up."""
```
- This is the **document** you are analyzing.
- You can replace it with any other text later if needed.

---

## 4. **Sentence Tokenization**

```python
sentence_tokens = sent_tokenize(text)
```
- Breaks the paragraph into **individual sentences**.

‚úÖ (You needed tokenization for your problem.)

---

## 5. **Word Tokenization**

```python
word_tokens = word_tokenize(text)
```
- Breaks the text into **individual words and punctuations**.

‚úÖ (You needed tokenization for your problem.)

---

## 6. **Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging**

```python
pos_tags = pos_tag(word_tokens)
```
- Tags every word with its **grammar role** like:
  - *NN* (noun), *VB* (verb), *JJ* (adjective), etc.

‚úÖ (You needed POS tagging for your problem.)

---

## 7. **Stop Words Removal**

```python
stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))
filtered_words = [word for word in word_tokens if word.lower() not in stop_words and word not in string.punctuation]
```
- Removes **stopwords** (like "is", "for", "the") because they don't add meaning.
- Also removes **punctuation** (like "." "," "'" etc.).

‚úÖ (You needed stopwords removal.)

---

## 8. **Stemming**

```python
ps = PorterStemmer()
stemmed_words = [ps.stem(word) for word in filtered_words]
```
- **Stemming** cuts a word down to its **root form**:
  - *running* ‚Üí *run*
  - *seasonal* ‚Üí *season*

‚úÖ (You needed stemming.)

---

## 9. **Lemmatization**

```python
lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()
lemmatized_words = [lemmatizer.lemmatize(word.lower()) for word in filtered_words]
```
- **Lemmatization** returns a **valid dictionary word**:
  - *better* ‚Üí *good*
  - *feet* ‚Üí *foot*

‚úÖ (You needed lemmatization.)

---

## 10. **Create a Cleaned Version of Document**

```python
cleaned_text = ' '.join(lemmatized_words)
```
- Joins the list of **lemmatized words** back into a **single clean string**.

---
## 11. **TF-IDF Calculation**

```python
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
tfidf_matrix = vectorizer.fit_transform([cleaned_text])
```
- **TF** = how frequently a word appears in the document.
- **IDF** = how unique or rare the word is across documents.
- Together **TF-IDF** gives more importance to **meaningful and rare words**.

‚úÖ (You needed TF and IDF representation.)

---

## 12. **Print TF-IDF Scores**

```python
feature_names = vectorizer.get_feature_names_out()
for col in range(tfidf_matrix.shape[1]):
    print(f"{feature_names[col]}: {tfidf_matrix[0, col]:.4f}")
```
- Displays each **word** along with its **TF-IDF value**.
- Higher the value ‚Üí more important the word.

# üöÄ In Short:
| Step | Meaning |
|:---|:---|
| 1 | Break document into sentences and words |
| 2 | Tag words with grammar labels |
| 3 | Remove unimportant words and punctuations |
| 4 | Bring words to base forms (root or dictionary form) |
| 5 | Represent document with meaningful numbers (TF-IDF) |

---

# üèÜ Conclusion:
‚úÖ Now this code fully **meets your problem statement**  
‚úÖ Very clean, professional, optimized version  
‚úÖ Ready for **submission** or **project use**

---

# ‚ö° Bonus Tip:

If you want even better TF-IDF results, you can use **`TfidfVectorizer(ngram_range=(1,2))`** to capture word pairs (bigrams) like "*Real Madrid*" together.

---

Would you also like me to give you a small **flowchart** üß© to show the full process (tokenization ‚Üí POS tagging ‚Üí stopword removal ‚Üí stemming ‚Üí lemmatization ‚Üí TF-IDF) visually?  
It'll look very professional if you add it to your project/report. üéØüöÄ
